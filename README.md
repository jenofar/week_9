# Map animation 
In map animation we have a marker placed in MIT and travel to Harvard. The marker shows the stops between MIT and Harvard while it moves 

### Steps to Run the Project
Touch the marker to make it travel from MIT to Harvard 

### Future Improvements
This Project can be further enhanced by using animated graphs to make it look more realistic
